/* Last updated with phpSmug 3.0
 *
 * This example file shows you how to get a list of albums from your own gallery, 
 * using your email address and password to authenticate and then display 
 * thumbnails of all the images in the first album found.
 *
 * You'll need to replace:
 * - <API KEY> with one provided by SmugMug: http://www.smugmug.com/hack/apikeys 
 * - <APP NAME/VER (URL)> with your application name, version and URL
 * - <EMAILADDRESS> with your email address
 * - <PASSWORD> with your SmugMug password
 *
 * The <APP NAME/VER (URL)> is NOT required, but it's encouraged as it will
 * allow SmugMug diagnose any issues users may have with your application if
 * they request help on the SmugMug forums.
 *
 * You can see this example in action at http://phpsmug.com/examples/
