# smug-php-uploader BETA
SmugMug PHP Uploder Code for Photo Booths. This is totally BETA and super sipmle in it's approach.

In both the index.php and upload.php you'll need to replace:
<API KEY> with one provided by SmugMug: http://www.smugmug.com/hack/apikeys
<EMAILADDRESS> with your email address
<PASSWORD> with your SmugMug password
 
 Also, this will need to be placed on a local server that supports PHP and is internet connected. Nothing new.
 
 Further directory setup instructions are in the php pages.
